This was the class project I had to complete with a team of my other students for my Web Based Programming course.  My repsonsibilities were:

1) Build the navigation menu
2) Program the home menu
3) Design the look and feel of the site

This was my first experience designing and building a website, and it shows!  However, we ended up getting the highest grade in the class, so
that's got to count for something!

Note: I did not take, or claim to own any of the images featured in this project.
